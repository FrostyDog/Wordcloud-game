# Wordcloud

## This project is created to show-off a bit of my skilz and to cosy play with your team mates.

Proudly made with Angular 11 (Ivy <3>)

Cloud was not implemented - great vertical list of words instead.

[Deployed version](https://wordcloud-game.vercel.app)

Most of the potential reusable logic was moved to the `services`, while only strictly component releted stuff were left in `components`.
`directive` folder is empty, and was created for the future purposes.

#### P.S. Mr. Konrad - hope you had a nice day and will enjoy checking this repo.
